		<h3>Choose Molecule</h3>
		First, from the drop down menu, a molecule can be chosen.  When clicked, it will automatically be rendered in the display window.
		
		<h3>Select Site</h3>
		The list of sites viewable for that specific molecule will be shown in a dynamic menu.  Click on a label to show the sites under that category, and select the site(s) to be displayed on the molecule.  The site will appear as a colored surface, and hovering over the site will display the site name.
		
		<h3>Accessibility Map</h3>
		Using a four angstrom probe as modeled in SPOCK, the molecular accessibility of the collagen microfibril, when in its native packing structure, was generated and the map can be displayed on the Jmol window, translucent to the binding and mutation sites.  The red portions of the map indicate high accessibility, while the blue portions indicate a limited or hidden accessibility. 
		
		<h3>Display Settings</h3>
		There are several options to alter the display settings of the molecule.  The three rendering options, ball and stick, trace and ribbons can be toggled with check boxes.  When ball and stick is check, the atom and bond sizes can be varied or turned off.  Finally, the color of the background and the atoms can be changed with the drop down menus.
		
		<h3>Amino Acid Sequence Search</h3>
		When collagen is displayed, an amino acid sequence can be found and displayed by typing the sequence into the text box. "Next" will show sites one at a time, while "All" will display all of them simultaneously.  These sites are displayed with a yellow surface.  
		
		<h3>Single vs. Dual</h3>
		These two displays allow the user the ability to view the molecule in a large display, or compare two molecules side by side.
	
		<h3>Jmol Features</h3>
		Jmol offers a variety of built in features for applet versatility.  These features can be accessed by right clicking on the menu and selecting the desired options, or clicking on Console to input commands manually.  Additional features include measuring the distance between atoms and calculating the angle between atoms, both done by double clicking the initial and final desired atoms.
